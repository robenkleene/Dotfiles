" Use system clipboard
" Delibrately ommitted because the custom clipboard `augroup` handles the
" clipboard (and also supports `tmux`). Also having this causes line breaks to
" be misshandled when copying lines (e.g., `yy`)
" New strategy is to not use system clipboard with `safecopy` and instead just
" use Vim's system clipboard support, which will automatically integrate with
" the numbered registers so that pasting from the system clipboard over a
" visual selection doesn't lose the system clipboard, which it does with the
" `safecopy` based system
