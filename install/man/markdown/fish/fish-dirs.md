- `pushd`: Add directory to the stack (e.g., `pushd (fd <term>)`
- `prevd` / `nextd`: Navigate to previous / next directory from history (i.e., use these instead of `popd` and `pushd` to get a similar affect as `autopushd` in `zsh`)
- `dirh`: Show directory history
- `cdh`: Choose a directory to visit from history

# Directory Stack
