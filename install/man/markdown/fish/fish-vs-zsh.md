- `vim (pbpaste)` works in Fish but not `zsh`
- `zsh` is less reliably about completing command-line flags
- Fish universal variables can be synced without restarting Fish, e.g., so configuration changes don't require spawning a new shell
- Fish has a binding for copying the current command line built-in
- Fish is faster
- Fish requires less configuration (and is therefore less problem prone)
- Fish `^R` search is more powerful, e.g., type `rg` `â†‘` then `^R` to search just `rg` commands for a term
