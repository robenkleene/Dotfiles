Using the shell kill ring to construct commands combining multiple commands from history:

1. Use `‚åÉU` to kill the current command line
2. Use `^R` to find another command to combine with
3. Use `^Y` to paste the original command in the correct location

Repeat combining as many commands as necessary.
