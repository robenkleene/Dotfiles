# `nvim` vs `vim`

- Broadly speaking, `nvim` is better at IDE features (like LSP, DAP, Tree-Sitter) because it supports a more sophisticated programming language (Lua).
- `vim` tends to be faster, because it has less built-in

## Languages

### Markdown

- When `nvim` enters a new line with an indented list, it adds the new item indented appropriately. *`vim` can also do this with the `set autoindent` option*
- `nvim` disables spell checking in URLs
