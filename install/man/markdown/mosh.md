# `mosh`

- `^^.` (Control-^ then .): Quit, note that in Blink Shell, the `^` above the keyboard in the accessory view does not work, you need to hit the version in the keyboard.
- Kill server with `pkill mosh-server` (this will of course kill your connection, but you should be able to reconnect again immediately)
