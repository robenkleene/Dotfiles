- `M-c`: Capitalize current word
- `M-l`: Lowercase current word
- `M-u`: Uppercase current word
- `C-_` / `C-X u` / `C-X C-u`: Undo
- `M-C--`: Insert previous parameter (this can take a prefix argument to get other parameters, for example `M-2 M-C--` to get the second to last)
- `M-m`: Insert previous word, subsequent presses cycle through previous words (not a default binding, but a common convention)
- `M-.` / `M-_`: Insert last parameter of previous command, subsequent presses go back through previous commands (e.g., `M-. M-.` gets the last parameter two commands ago, this can take a prefix argument to get other parameters, for example `M-2 M-.` to get the second last) Note that undo is useful if you go backwards for too many parameters.
- `M-'`: Quote the line (e.g., to use `su -c` or `ssh`)
- `M-h`: Help for current command (runs `man`)
- `C-q`: Push current line (clears the line, execute one command and then return the line)
- `C-y`: Yank
- `C-w`: Kill last word (or parameter)
- `M-<return>`: Insert new line without accepting command (e.g., to extend the command to multiple lines)

# Navigating Parameters

# Autoload

```
autoload -Uz copy-earlier-word
zle -N copy-earlier-word
bindkey -e "^[m" copy-earlier-word
```

`copy-earlier-word`

- Cycle through previous parameters. Just using this binding goes through parameters of the current line, but if first the last parameter of a previous line is inserted with `M-.`, then this will find previous parameters on that line. Note that undo is useful to go backwards.

# History

- `^r`: Reverse history search
- `^s`: Reverse history search
- `â‡¥`: Accept a history match, without executing it
- `history 0`: Dump full history

(Just use a movement command (like `^[a` or `^[e`) to dismiss the search.)

## Menu

When the menu is visible to select various options.

## Bindings

`man zshzle` for what each widget does.

- `zle -la`: List all available commands to bind
- `bindkey -l`: List key maps
- `bindkey -M emacs`: List bindings for a key map
- `bindkey -M menuselect`: Bindings for tab menu
- `bindkey -L`: List currently active bindings
- `bindkey -e "^X^E" edit-command-line`: Set a binding for emacs key map
