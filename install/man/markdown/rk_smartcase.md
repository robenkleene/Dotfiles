# Pros

- Smart case works well with the workflow of taking a broad search and then narrowing it. Often it makes sense to start with a case-insensitive search and then switch to a more specific search.

# Cons

- Most utilities default to case-sensitive, which means having to adjust configuration options to change it.
- It's sometimes unpredictable where the setting works, e.g., Vim's `:filter` command does not use the `smartcase` option.
