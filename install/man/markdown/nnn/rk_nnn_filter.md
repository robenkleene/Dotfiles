- `/`: Filter file list
- `^L`: Toggle last filter
- `^N`: Toggle `type-to-nav` (`⌃D` to exit)

# Active Filter

Including `type-to-nav` mode.

- `⎋`, `⌃D`: Exit an active filter.

# Notes

The active filter is removed when changing the directory contents, which can be annoying when trying to search and rename several files at once. A good work around is to use the `r` mode to edit the results in `EDITOR`.
