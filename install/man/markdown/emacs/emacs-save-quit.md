# Emacs Quitting

If there are modified buffers, to review them use:

1. Review with `<C-r>`
2. Diff with `d`
3. Save with `<SPC>` (or `y`) or `n` not save, `<C-f>` to edit the buffer

But it's usually even faster just to jump straight to the diff (often the buffer will match what's on disk):

1. Diff with `d`
2. Save with space or `<C-f>` to edit the buffer
