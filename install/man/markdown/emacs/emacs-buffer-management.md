# Open Recent

- `C-x C-f`, or `M-x find-file-at-point` has a history that contains all recent files. It can be accessed either by using the up and down arrow keys, or by using incremental search (`C-s` or `C-r`, the latter being a particularly fast way to access previous files).
- `C-x C-f` populates with the current location by default, you can usually just ignore this and paste in a relative path to edit it, or type `~` or `/` to edit a file relative to one of those paths.
