# Emacs Grep

- `grep`: Run a user-specified `grep` command and put the results in a `grep-mode` buffer
- `compilation-minor-mode` and `compilation-shell-minor-mode` can be used to quickly make grep match strings clickable to jump to the file. The `compilation-shell-minor-mode` version uses bindings that won't conflict with `shell-mode`, so it's good to use in a shell buffer.
