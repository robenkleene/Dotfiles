# Emacs Untitled

Notes for managing untitled files.

- Buffers without an associated file aren't auto-saved by default, so turn on auto-save for them.
- The `default-directory` is used as the auto-save directory, so one way to manage them is set it before creating the untitled buffer, that way all untitled buffers will be saved to the same directory.
