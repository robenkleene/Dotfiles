# Smartparens

- `M-D`: Unwrap s-expression, e.g., remove parenthesis or quotes
- `C-M-b` / `C-M-f`: Move forward and backward by s-expression
- `C-M-SPC`: Select current s-expression
- `C-M-w`: Copy s-expression

## Fixing Issues

After pasting in text, often the parenthesis are unbalanced, use this command to fix it:

- `C-q` (`quoted-insert`): This can be used to enter parenthesis to fix the balance issues
