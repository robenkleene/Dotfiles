# Org Mode Time Tracking

- `C-c C-x C-i` / `C-c C-x C-o`: Clock in to current task / out of task
- `C-c C-x C-x`: Clock back into last task
- `C-c C-x C-j`: Go to current clocked into task
- `C-c C-x C-q`: Cancel current clock in without logging time

## Dates

- `M-S-<down>` / `M-S-<up>`: Decrease / increase logged time by five minutes (also adjusts previously logged items)
    - This can be used to log a conversation that takes you away from a task, e.g., make a new task for the conversation, and adjust it's time with `M-S-<down>` / `M-S-<up>`, and the previous active task will automatically be corrected as well.
