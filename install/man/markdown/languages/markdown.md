## Backticks

To include a backtick, use multiple backticks as the delimiter:

	``There is a literal backtick (`) here.``

You can also include spaces around the delimiter to make it clearer (the spaces will be removed):

	`` ` ``

This is the clearest way to write a keyboard shortcut that includes a backtick:

	- `` ^` ``: Cycle editor focus

## Lists

For multi-paragraph list items, indent the lines as much as the previous paragraph, e.g.:

	# Instructions
	
	1. First sentence
	2. Second sentence
	
	    This is a second sentence in the same paragraph.
	
	3. Third sentence
	4. Fourth sentence
