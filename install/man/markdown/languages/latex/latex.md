# Latex

- `\textstyle`: Set the display style for inline, for example within a paragraph. In contrast to `\displaystyle` to larger math, for example on its own line.
- `\left` and `\right` adjust the size of delimiters to match their content. E.g., in `R_x(30^\circ) = -\arctan\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)`, the `\left(` and `\right)`, make the parentheses match the size of the content: $R_x(30^\circ) = -\arctan\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)$.
