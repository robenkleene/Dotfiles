- `pyenv` only manages Python executable versions, not dependencies (unlike similar programs like `ruby-version` and `nvm`). So since we're only using one Python version this provides no benefit, so Python is installed via Homebrew.
- Python global dependencies should be installed with `pip install --usr`.
