- `draw()` and `setup()` can be omitted for a static scene
- Functions like `fill()` and `stroke()` don't apply to a specific object, instead they set a global state that affects all subsequent shapes
- Angles, like for the `rotateY` function are specified in radians
- After `size(w, h)` is called the builtin variables `width` and `height` are set
