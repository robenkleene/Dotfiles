Only big movements (e.g., `gg`, `G`) get added to the jump list, not movements within a line (like `0`, `$`, `f`, `t`). There is not a way to go back from a movement within a line.

- `:[ju]mps`: Show the `jumplist`
- `<C-o>`: Go to the previous position in the `jumplist`
- `<C-i>`: Go to the next position in the `jumplist`
