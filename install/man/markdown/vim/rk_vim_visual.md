- `âŒƒv`: Visual Block Mode
- `gv`: Reselect last visual block

- `vip`: Select paragraph
- `va{V`: Select current function

Text cut with `^v` or `v` is `blockwise`, if you then paste it, the text will interleave with any lines it overlaps with. To get around this behavior, just use the `:put` command, which pastes the text as if it were yanked `linewise`.

## Visual Block Mode

Easy to edit before and after the selection:

1. `C-v`: Start the selection
2. `hjkl`: Select the relevant text

# Inserting Text Before / After Selection

Use `I` or `A` to insert text at the beginning or end of the selection

# Deleting Text From the Start of the Line

Just make selection and hit `x`

# Deleting Text to the End of the Line

Difficult with visual block mode, but `<range>norm!` (the `!` ignores mappings) can be used in a pinch, e.g., `%norm! ED` to delete everything after the first big word on each line in the file.
