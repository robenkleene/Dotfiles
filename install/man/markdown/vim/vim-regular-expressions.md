# `vim` Regular Expressions

- Find and replace whole words only, use `s/\<word\>/newword/g`. (Note that the `*` and `#` commands populate the current word with this, so you can get use those commands to populate the `/` register with the search term.)

## Notes

`magic` is the default setting, this means non-greedy is `\{-}` and capture groups is `\(\)`.

## Pattern Modifiers

* `/\v`: Very magic search makes most special characters take on their meaning.
* `/\V`: `verynomagic` search, no special characters, everything is interpreted literally.
* `/\c`: Ignore case
* `/\C`: Case sensitive

By default Vim searches for the literal characters for most punctuation (excluding `[]`, `.`, `*`, others? These need to be normally need to be escaped).
