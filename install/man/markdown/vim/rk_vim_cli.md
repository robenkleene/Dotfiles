- `-q <file>`: Process error list (there isn't a way to use this with standard input, `vim -q <(<command>)` works sometimes, but seems to try to execute backticks so should be avoided)
- `-c {command}`
- Use `|` for multiple commands, e.g., `rg <term> | vim -c 'lcd <backtick>hgroot<backtick> | cb' -`
