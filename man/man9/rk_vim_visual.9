\f[CR]âŒƒv\f[R]: Visual Block Mode
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]gv\f[R]: Reselect last visual block
.PP
Text cut with \f[CR]\[ha]v\f[R] or \f[CR]v\f[R] is \f[CR]blockwise\f[R],
if you then paste it, the text will interleave with any lines it
overlaps with.
To get around this behavior, just use the \f[CR]:put\f[R] command, which
pastes the text as if it were yanked \f[CR]linewise\f[R].
.SS Visual Block Mode
Easy to edit before and after the selection:
.IP "1." 3
\f[CR]C\-v\f[R]: Start the selection
.IP "2." 3
\f[CR]hjkl\f[R]: Select the relevant text
.SH Inserting Text Before / After Selection
Use \f[CR]I\f[R] or \f[CR]A\f[R] to insert text at the beginning or end
of the selection
.SH Deleting Text From the Start of the Line
Just make selection and hit \f[CR]x\f[R]
.SH Deleting Text to the End of the Line
Difficult with visual block mode, but \f[CR]<range>norm!\f[R] (the
\f[CR]!\f[R] ignores mappings) can be used in a pinch, e.g.,
\f[CR]%norm! ED\f[R] to delete everything after the first big word on
each line in the file.
