.SH Notes
.IP \[bu] 2
It\[cq]s not possible for \f[CR]rsync\f[R] to sync to a directory where
the user does not have permissions.
E.g., \f[CR]rsync\f[R] does not have the capabilities to ask for a
\f[CR]sudo\f[R] password.
.SH What Gets Synced
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]rsync\f[R] checks modification dates and file sizes when it
determines which files to sync.
.IP \[bu] 2
There\[cq]s an option \f[CR]\-c, \-\-checksum\f[R] that makes it only
sync files that have changed by checksum, but that option makes
\f[CR]rsync\f[R] run significantly slower.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]git\f[R] does not sync file modification times, so if the same
\f[CR]git\f[R] repo is synced from multiple clones to the same
destination, everything will have to be re\-synced.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-O, \-\-omit\-dir\-times\f[R]: Ignores just directory times,
which aren\[cq]t important anyway.
