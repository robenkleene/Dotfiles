Notes for managing untitled files.
.IP \[bu] 2
Buffers without an associated file aren\[cq]t auto\-saved by default, so
turn on auto\-save for them.
.IP \[bu] 2
The \f[CR]default\-directory\f[R] is used as the auto\-save directory,
so one way to manage them is set it before creating the untitled buffer,
that way all untitled buffers will be saved to the same directory.
