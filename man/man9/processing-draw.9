\f[CR]setup()\f[R] is called once, \f[CR]draw()\f[R] is called once per
frame
.IP \[bu] 2
If \f[CR]setup()\f[R] and \f[CR]draw()\f[R] are omitted the code
executes once, even without including \f[CR]noLoop()\f[R] (this is
probably a bad practice though, because creating functions will then
create a syntax error)
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]noLoop()\f[R] in \f[CR]setup()\f[R] makes \f[CR]draw()\f[R] called
only once (e.g., for exporting images), in this case \f[CR]noLoop()\f[R]
should be the last line of \f[CR]setup()\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]setup()\f[R] and \f[CR]draw()\f[R] reset the coordinate system,
(so \f[CR]transform()\f[R] calls will be reset after \f[CR]setup()\f[R]
finishes and need to be re\-applied in \f[CR]draw()\f[R]
