\f[CR]C\-q C\-j\f[R]: Enter a line break in the minibuffer (i.e.,

.SH Stuck Minibuffer
If the minibuffer becomes stuck with a partial command, the solution is
to focus it, either with the mouse or \f[CR]C\-x o\f[R], then hit
\f[CR]C\-g\f[R].
(Note that performing another minibuffer command, e.g.,
\f[CR]M\-x C\-g\f[R] will not fix it.)
.PP
This probably happens when the minibuffer has an active command and then
focus is lost (e.g., when clicking into the popup from a
\f[CR]<partial\-command>\-<tab>\f[R].
