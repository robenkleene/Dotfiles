This is probably related to having installed a bunch more Gems at
\f[CR]\[ti]/.gem/ruby/2.5.3/gems\f[R] to support the release notes blog.
.PP
This reason this happens:
.IP "1." 3
Bash runs the
\f[CR]#!/System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/2.3/usr/bin/ruby\f[R]
executable
.IP "2." 3
The gem paths are pointed to the \f[CR]2.5.3\f[R] gems, so it attempts
to load gems for 2.5.3 while running the 2.3 binary.
.PP
It looks like this can be fixed by adding \f[CR]\-\-disable\-gems\f[R]
to the shebang line.
