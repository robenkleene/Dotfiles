.SH Backticks
To include a backtick, use multiple backticks as the delimiter:
.IP
.EX
\[ga]\[ga]There is a literal backtick (\[ga]) here.\[ga]\[ga]
.EE
.PP
You can also include spaces around the delimiter to make it clearer (the
spaces will be removed):
.IP
.EX
\[ga]\[ga] \[ga] \[ga]\[ga]
.EE
.PP
This is the clearest way to write a keyboard shortcut that includes a
backtick:
.IP
.EX
\- \[ga]\[ga] \[ha]\[ga] \[ga]\[ga]: Cycle editor focus
.EE
.SH Lists
For multi\-paragraph list items, indent the lines as much as the
previous paragraph, e.g.:
.IP
.EX
