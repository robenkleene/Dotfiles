B allows piping just a selection through a shell command, as opposed to
whole lines, which is all \f[CR]vim\f[R] supports by default.
.SH Tab Completion
Including \f[CR]B\f[R] in the \f[CR]vim\f[R] command line doesn\[cq]t
work with tab completion (e.g., \f[CR]\[aq]<,\[aq]>B !f_\f[R] followed
by tab won\[cq]t complete shell commands that start with \f[CR]f_\f[R]).
.PP
A workaround is to use \f[CR]\[aq]<,\[aq]> !f_\f[R] to tab complete,
then navigate to earlier in the command to add the B (e.g., use
\f[CR]<S\-right>\f[R] to go back a word).
