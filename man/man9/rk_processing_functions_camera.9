\f[CR]eyeX, eyeY, eyeZ\f[R]: Position of the camera
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]centerX, centerY, centerZ\f[R]: Position the camera is pointed at
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]upX, upY, upZ\f[R]: Defines the up direction (e.g.,
\f[CR]0, 1, 0\f[R] is a vector representing the Y axis as up, since the
vector just defines a direction \f[CR]0, 0.1, 0\f[R] is identical).
This defines the \[lq]roll\[rq] of the camera, i.e., rotation of the
camera.
A vector of \f[CR]0, 0, 0\f[R] is invalid and means the camera will not
work.
