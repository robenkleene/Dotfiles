When analyzing a complicated tree structure, to figure out whether a
node is a descendent of another node, the best method is to use
\f[CR]grep\f[R] with an \f[CR]|\f[R] (or) match like this:
.IP
.EX
grep \[aq]property|name\[aq] < foo.json
.EE
.PP
E.g., if you want to check whether a node with a particular name has
another node with a particular property as an ancestor, we can tell by
looking at the indentation.
