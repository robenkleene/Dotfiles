.SH Goals
BEM helps with specificity problems, e.g., if someone says
\f[CR].nav a\f[R] means \[lq]select all links inside
\f[CR]nav\f[R]\[rq], but what they really wanted was \[lq]select all
\f[CR]nav\f[R] menu links (and nothing else)\[rq].
A class like \f[CR]nav__link\f[R] will never select other links that
happen to be inside \f[CR]nav\f[R].
BEM also survives markup restructuring, e.g., a selector like
\f[CR].nav > ul > li > a\f[R] will not work if that structure changes.
.SH Notes
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Block\f[R]: A standalone entity (\f[CR].block\f[R]).
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Element\f[R]: Something that is only ever nested inside a block
(\f[CR].block__elem\f[R]).
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Modifier\f[R]: Types of blocks or elements
(\f[CR].block\-\-mod\f[R] or \f[CR].block__elem\-\-mod\f[R]).
.SH Rules
.IP \[bu] 2
Never nest CSS rules
.IP \[bu] 2
You should apply a reset to the element you are styling.
.IP \[bu] 2
Avoid tag selectors
.SH Resets
BEM does not recommend CSS resets because it break independence.
If the reset is not applied, then the style will not look right,
therefore the styles are not independent.
