\f[CR]\-q <file>\f[R]: Process error list (there isn\[cq]t a way to use
this with standard input, \f[CR]vim \-q <(<command>)\f[R] works
sometimes, but seems to try to execute backticks so should be avoided)

\f[CR]\-c {command}\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
Use \f[CR]|\f[R] for multiple commands, e.g.,
\f[CR]rg <term> | vim \-c \[aq]lcd <backtick>hgroot<backtick> | cb\[aq] \-\f[R]
