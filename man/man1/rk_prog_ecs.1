ECS is an implementation of data\-orientated programming.
This means the design of the architecture has empathy about how the CPU
works.
.PP
In Object\-Orientated programming:
.IP
.EX
class Player : public GameObject {
  float position[3];
  float velocity[3];
  int health;
  // ...methods...
};
std::vector<Player> players;
.EE
.IP
.EX
struct Position { float x, y, z; };
struct Velocity { float vx, vy, vz; };
struct Health { int value; };
std::vector<Position> positions;
std::vector<Velocity> velocities;
std::vector<Health> healths;
// Systems process all positions, velocities, or healths in tight loops
.EE

The ECS example is more memory efficient because memory is accessed as
contiguous data (i.e., vectors) instead of scattered around memory (OOP
member variables).
This results in \(lqcache misses\(rq which is the term when data has to
be accessed via the heap, instead of from, e.g., the fast the L1/L2
cache on the CPU (when the data is first accessed, that\(cqs always
considered a cache miss, this is called a \(lqcompulsory miss\(rq).
.PP
ECS also enables parallelism, e.g., multiple entities can be updated on
different threads simultaneously.
.IP
.EX
int arr[1000];
// First access to arr[0] will be a compulsory miss
int x = arr[0]; // Cache miss (first time)
// Second access to arr[0] will be a cache hit (if not evicted)
x = arr[0]; // Cache hit (if still in cache)
.EE
