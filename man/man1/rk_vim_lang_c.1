But the C standard library is documented in \f[CR]man\f[R] pages, so you
can look up a function declaration where the cursor is for standard
library functions with the \f[CR]K\f[R] command.

following in \f[CR]ftplugin/c.vim\f[R], Vim\[cq]s \f[CR]gf\f[R] command
can be used to jump an included header file where the cursor is.
