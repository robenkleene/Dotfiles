.TH "RK_REFERENCE Reference" "" "" ""
.SH Reference
Illustrates two examples of returning a reference to a member variable,
one where that member variable is pointer, the other where it\[cq]s a
reference.
The reference is preferable because with the pointer, if the pointer
gets set to \f[CR]nullptr\f[R], we\[cq]ll be dereferencing a null
pointer when accessing the getter.
With a reference, it\[cq]s a compile error to try to set the reference
to \f[CR]nullptr\f[R].
