.SH Pros
.IP \(bu 2
Smart case works well with the workflow of taking a broad search and
then narrowing it.
Often it makes sense to start with a case\-insensitive search and then
switch to a more specific search.
.SH Cons
.IP \(bu 2
Most utilities default to case\-sensitive, which means having to adjust
configuration options to change it.
.IP \(bu 2
It\(cqs sometimes unpredictable where the setting works, e.g., Vim\(cqs
\f[CR]:filter\f[R] command does not use the \f[CR]smartcase\f[R] option.
