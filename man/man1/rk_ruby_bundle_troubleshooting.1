.SH Wrong Version of Ruby
If \f[CR]echo $PATH\f[R] is showing one version of Ruby, but when
executing commands like \f[CR]rake\f[R] and \f[CR]bundle\f[R] is using a
different version of Ruby, this could be because a version of Ruby is
hard\-coded into the shebang line of the path.
You can check this by running, the following command:
.IP
.EX
head \-n1 $(which bundle)
.EE
.PP
If that shows the wrong version of Ruby, then usually
\f[CR]gem install bundle\f[R] will fix it.
.SH Wrong Version of Bundler
To fix:
.IP
.EX
can\[aq]t find gem bundler (>= 0.a) with executable bundle (Gem::GemNotFoundException)
.EE
.PP
Get the \f[CR]BUNDLED WITH\f[R] version from \f[CR]Gemfile.lock\f[R] and
run:
.IP
.EX
gem install bundler \-v <version>
.EE
.PP
A better solution is probably just to delete the \f[CR]Gemfile.lock\f[R]
and run \f[CR]bundle install\f[R] again.
