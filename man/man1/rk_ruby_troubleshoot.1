.SH Library not loaded
An error like this can appear when running Ruby if the version of a
library Ruby was compiled against gets removed.
This often happens with \f[CR]openssl\f[R], the error includes line like
this:
.IP
.EX
Library not loaded: /usr/local/opt/openssl/lib/libcrypto.1.0.0.dylib (LoadError)
.EE
.PP
What\(cqs happened in this case is that Homebrew has updated
\f[CR]openssl\f[R] and that \f[CR]dylib\f[R] is no longer at that
location.
.PP
The easiest way to fix this is to just delete and re\-install Ruby and
it will be installed with a reference to the newer version of
\f[CR]openssl\f[R].
