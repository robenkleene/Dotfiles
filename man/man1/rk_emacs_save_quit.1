If there are modified buffers, to review them use:
.IP "1." 3
Review with \f[CR]<C\-r>\f[R]
.IP "2." 3
Diff with \f[CR]d\f[R]
.IP "3." 3
Save with \f[CR]<SPC>\f[R] (or \f[CR]y\f[R]) or \f[CR]n\f[R] not save,
\f[CR]<C\-f>\f[R] to edit the buffer
.PP
But it\[cq]s usually even faster just to jump straight to the diff
(often the buffer will match what\[cq]s on disk):
.IP "1." 3
Diff with \f[CR]d\f[R]
.IP "2." 3
Save with space or \f[CR]<C\-f>\f[R] to edit the buffer
