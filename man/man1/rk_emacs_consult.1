.SH \f[CR]rg\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]M\-n\f[R] will insert the thing at point
.IP \[bu] 2
Flags after \f[CR]\-\-\f[R] are passed to the underlying command
\f[CR]<term> \-\- \-g *.el\f[R] (note this doesn\[cq]t work with
\f[CR]\[aq]*.el\[aq]\f[R], and \f[CR]fd\f[R] should be
\f[CR]\-\- \-g \[dq]*.{js,ts}\[dq]\f[R] but that doesn\[cq]t work, maybe
because with \f[CR]fd\f[R] you have to omit the search term?)
.RS 2
.IP \[bu] 2
For some reason, single quotes don\[cq]t work when passing flags this
way, e.g., \f[CR]\-g \[dq]*.cpp\[dq]\f[R] will work but not
\f[CR]\-g \[aq]*.cpp\[aq]\f[R]
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
A second \f[CR]#\f[R] to add Vertico searches after \f[CR]rg\f[R]
filtering, e.g., \f[CR]#TODO#!today\f[R] will return for all matches for
\f[CR]TODO\f[R] from \f[CR]rg\f[R] and then filter those in Vertico to
remove lines that match \f[CR]today\f[R].
.SS Consult Buffers
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]consult\-buffers\f[R] contains \f[CR]Buffers\f[R],
\f[CR]Files\f[R], and \f[CR]Bookmarks\f[R] these can be filter by typing
a letter to represent a group followed by space.
E.g., \f[CR]b SPC\f[R] will search for buffers, \f[CR]f SPC\f[R] will
search files, and \f[CR]m SPC\f[R] will search bookmarks.
\f[CR]DEL\f[R] will then go back to searching everything.
