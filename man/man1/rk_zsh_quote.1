.IP \[bu] 2
Backslashes have no meaning inside \f[CR]\[aq]\f[R] in \f[CR]zsh\f[R],
this means it\[cq]s not easy to have a single quote inside a string
quoted with single quotes.
.IP \[bu] 2
At the \f[CR]quote>\f[R] prompt, there\[cq]s no way to go back and edit
the previous command directly, the best solution is to do
\f[CR]\[ha]C\f[R], then \f[CR]â†‘\f[R]
