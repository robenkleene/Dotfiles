When performing these steps:
.IP "1." 3
Yank some text
.IP "2." 3
Visually select some text
.IP "3." 3
Paste
.IP "4." 3
Visually select some text again
.IP "5." 3
Paste again
.PP
At #5, what\(cqs pasted is what was visually selected at #2, not what
was yanked in #1.
.PP
There are two ways to get around this:
.IP "1." 3
At #1, yank to a named register \f[CR]\(dqay\f[R], and paste from that
register in the remaining steps \f[CR]\(dqap\f[R].
.IP "2." 3
At #5, paste from the yank register instead \f[CR]\(dq0p\f[R]
.SH New Line Characters
The \f[CR]g_\f[R] operator, goes to the end of the line without
selecting the new line character.
So to replace to the end of line without deleting the new line
character, use \f[CR]vg_\f[R].
.IP \(bu 2
\f[CR]v$\f[R]: Visual select to the end of the line, a \f[CR]y\f[R]
after this will include the new line
.IP \(bu 2
\f[CR]y$\f[R]: Yank to the end of the line, this will \f[I]not\f[R]
include the new line
.IP \(bu 2
\f[CR]zy\f[R]: Yank without trailing whitespace
.SH Quoted Strings
.IP \(bu 2
\f[CR]v2i\(dq\f[R]: Quoted String Including Quotes Without Whitespace
.SH Functions
.IP \(bu 2
\f[CR]Va{ok\f[R]: In a function block, this is usually the easiest way
to select the entire function.
\f[CR]Va{\f[R] starts a line\-wise visual selection, \f[CR]o\f[R]
switches the side of the selection being modified, and \f[CR]k\f[R]
moves up a line.
