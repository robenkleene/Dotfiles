.SH Vim Tasks Backtraces
Backtraces are usually only shows filenames with line numbers like
\f[CR]<filename>:<line\-number>:<column\-number>\f[R] (i.e., without
relative or absolute paths).
In a pinch, a quick way to be able to jump to these locations is to set
\f[CR]setl path+=**\f[R] to add recursive search to just the buffer with
the backtrace.
