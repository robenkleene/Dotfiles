B allows piping just a selection through a shell command, as opposed to
whole lines, which is all \f[CR]vim\f[R] supports by default.
.SH Tab Completion
Including \f[CR]B\f[R] in the \f[CR]vim\f[R] command line doesn\(cqt
work with tab completion (e.g., \f[CR]\(aq<,\(aq>B !f_\f[R] followed by
tab won\(cqt complete shell commands that start with \f[CR]f_\f[R]).
.PP
A workaround is to use \f[CR]\(aq<,\(aq> !f_\f[R] to tab complete, then
navigate to earlier in the command to add the B (e.g., use
\f[CR]<S\-right>\f[R] to go back a word).
