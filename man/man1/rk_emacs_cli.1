\f[CR]\-nw\f[R], \f[CR]\-\-no\-window\-system\f[R]: By default Emacs
will open a new buffer in GUI window, use \f[CR]\-nw\f[R] to open Emacs
in the terminal
.SH macOS
On macOS, doing \f[CR]emacs <file>\f[R] has a couple of caveats:
.IP "1." 3
The \f[CR]emacs <file>\f[R] process will not exit until the frame is
closed, so the terminal that \f[CR]emacs <file>\f[R] was run from
won\[cq]t be usable until the frame is closed.
.IP "2." 3
\f[CR]emacs <file>\f[R] opens a separate instance of
\f[CR]Emacs.app\f[R], so a separate Dock icon will appear for example.
.PP
For these reasons, it\[cq]s generally better on macOS to have
\f[CR]emacs <file>\f[R] behave as \f[CR]emacs \-nw\f[R], and open a file
in GUI Emacs with \f[CR]open \-a Emacs <file>\f[R]
