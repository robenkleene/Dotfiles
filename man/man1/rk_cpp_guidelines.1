Prefer references (\f[CR]Bar& foo\f[R]) over pointers
(\f[CR]Bar* foo\f[R]) because references can\[cq]t be null
.IP \[bu] 2
Always use \f[CR]const\f[R] if possible
.IP \[bu] 2
Use angle brackets (e.g., \f[CR]#include <foo>\f[R] or
\f[CR]#include <foo.h>\f[R]) for system and library includes, and quotes
(e.g., \f[CR]#include \[dq]bar.h\[dq]\f[R]) for project includes (even
though the quote style also supports system includes).
List project includes before system and library includes.
