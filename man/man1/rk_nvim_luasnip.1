Using pasted text in snippets with tokens is difficult because
\f[CR]SELECT\f[R] mode, which is used by default when filling out
snippets, doesn\[cq]t support pasting.
Here\[cq]s a workaround:
.IP "1." 3
Trigger the snippet then immediately escape back to \f[CR]NORMAL\f[R]
mode
.IP "2." 3
Yank the text to use in the snippet (this step can also be performed
before triggering the snippet)
.IP "3." 3
Use the \f[CR]c\f[R] operator to replace the token
.IP "4." 3
Paste from the \f[CR]0\f[R] register in \f[CR]INSERT\f[R] mode with
\f[CR]‚åÉR 0\f[R] (since the snippet is still active, this will also
replace all instances of the same token in the snippet)
