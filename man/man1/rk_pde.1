Functions like \f[CR]fill()\f[R] and \f[CR]stroke()\f[R] don\(cqt apply
to a specific object, instead they set a global state that affects all
subsequent shapes
.IP \(bu 2
Angles, like for the \f[CR]rotateY\f[R] function are specified in
radians
.IP \(bu 2
After \f[CR]size(w, h)\f[R] is called the builtin variables
\f[CR]width\f[R] and \f[CR]height\f[R] are set
