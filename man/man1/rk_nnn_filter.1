\f[CR]⎋\f[R], \f[CR]⌃D\f[R]: Exit an active filter.
.SH Notes
The active filter is removed when changing the directory contents, which
can be annoying when trying to search and rename several files at once.
A good work around is to use the \f[CR]r\f[R] mode to edit the results
in \f[CR]EDITOR\f[R].
