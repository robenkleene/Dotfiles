.IP \[bu] 2
Quoting a variable when using it prevents word splitting:
.IP
.EX
$ foo=\[dq]one two three\[dq]; for bar in $foo; do echo $bar; done
# one
# two
# three
$ foo=\[dq]one two three\[dq]; for bar in \[dq]$foo\[dq]; do echo $bar; done
# one two three
.EE
.PP
Note that in \f[CR]zsh\f[R] these are both the same because
\f[CR]zsh\f[R] does field splitting (this means \f[CR]echo $foo\f[R]
always passes in separate arguments, it\[cq]s the same as
\f[CR]echo one two three\f[R]).
To get the same behavior as Bash, use \f[CR]$=foo\f[R]:
.IP
.EX
foo=\[dq]one two three\[dq]; for bar in $=foo; do echo $bar; done
# one
# two
# three
.EE
