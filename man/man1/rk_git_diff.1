.SH Branch Comparison Strategy
.IP \[bu] 2
Use \f[CR]git diff \-\-name\-status master\f[R] to list the files that
have been added, changed, or removed.
.IP \[bu] 2
Use \f[CR]git difftool master \-\- <file path>\f[R] (defaults to
\f[CR]vimdiff\f[R]) to view side\-by\-side versions of a file.
Note that this works even if the file has been deleted from the working
tree, this can be useful to get syntax highlighting.
.IP \[bu] 2
Use \f[CR]git show master:<file path>\f[R] to show the contents of a
file.
Note that this doesn\[cq]t have syntax highlighting, \f[CR]bat\f[R] can
be used to add syntax highlighting (e.g.,
\f[CR]git git show master:<file path> | bat \-lswift\f[R]).
.IP \[bu] 2
Use \f[CR]git grep <search term> master\f[R] to search a different
branch
