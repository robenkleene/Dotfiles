\f[CR]hg histedit\f[R]: Interactive history re\-order
.SS Splitting (or Editing) a Commit
.IP "1." 3
Use \f[CR]hg histedit\f[R] and mark a commit as edit
.IP "2." 3
Use \f[CR]hg record\f[R] to selectively commit changes, including making
edits before hand or making multiple commits (note that while the edit
is in progress, multiple commits will be shown in the \f[CR]hg log\f[R],
i.e., the old commits and the new commits replacing them, but after
running \f[CR]hg histedit \-\-continue\f[R] the old commits will be
cleaned up)
.IP "3." 3
Use \f[CR]hg histedit \-c\f[R] (or \f[CR]hg histedit \-\-continue\f[R])
to finish
.IP \[bu] 2
Doing \f[CR]hg histedit \-\-continue\f[R] with uncommitted changes will
apply those changes to the commit being edited (e.g., to split a commit,
you can first commit some files with \f[CR]hg record\f[R] then just do
\f[CR]hg histedit \-\-continue\f[R] to add the remaining changes to the
commit being edited)
.IP \[bu] 2
Doing \f[CR]hg record \-\-amend\f[R] will apply any changes to the
\f[I]commit before being edited\f[R] (this is the current commit in
\f[CR]hg log\f[R]), so you can add some changes from the commit being
edited to the previous commit with \f[CR]hg record \-\-amend\f[R]
