\f[CR]eglot\f[R] uses \f[CR]Project.el\f[R] to find the root directory
of a project, which in turn looks for the version control root.
.PP
For projects that have a different root, the workaround is to add a
\f[CR].project.el\f[R] file to the root, a custom
\f[CR]project\-find\-functions\f[R] can then look for this method.
