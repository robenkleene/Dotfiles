To fix a conflict in a binary file (e.g., a binary file says
\f[CR]both modified\f[R]) by checking out both versions simultaneously
so they can be compared in an appropriate app for the file format:
.IP "1." 3
\f[CR]cp <conflicted\-file\-path> <conflicted\-file\-new\-path>\f[R]:
Copy the conflicted file to a different path (so the other version can
be checked out at the original file path)
.IP "2." 3
\f[CR]git checkout \-\-theirs <conflicted\-file\-path>\f[R]
.IP "3." 3
Open the two files and compare and merge
.IP "4." 3
Make sure what we want to keep is at \f[CR]<conflicted\-file\-path>\f[R]
and anything at \f[CR]<conflicted\-file\-new\-path>\f[R] is deleted
.IP "5." 3
\f[CR]git add . && git rebase \-\-continue\f[R]
