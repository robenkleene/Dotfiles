Pipe a patch to \f[CR]patch\f[R] to apply it
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\-\-merge\f[R] (or \f[CR]\-\-merge=diff3\f[R] to use
\f[CR]diff3\f[R] style which also includes the contents before either
conflicting change) apply conflicts in the file instead of creating
\f[CR].rej\f[R] files (note that the built in version of
\f[CR]patch\f[R] on macOS doesn\[cq]t support this, so instead use,
e.g., \f[CR]gpatch \-\-merge=diff3\f[R])
.SH Tricks
To apply a patch to an arbitrary file, just remove the section of the
patch that specifies the file path, \f[CR]patch\f[R] will then prompt
for a file path to apply it to.
.SH Troubleshooting
.IP \[bu] 2
For \f[CR]can\[aq]t find file to patch at input line X\f[R] errors, use
\f[CR]\-pN\f[R] where \f[CR]N\f[R] is the number of leading components
to strip (e.g., to clean a path like \f[CR]a/foo/bar\f[R],
\f[CR]\-p1\f[R] would strip the first component which is \f[CR]a/\f[R]
