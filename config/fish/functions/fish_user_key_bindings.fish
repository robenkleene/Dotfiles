# This fails occassionaly, and running the same command manually with single
# quotes instead of double around the term seems to fix it
# Just use `â†‘` `C-a` `history delete`, e.g., prefix the command to delete with `history delete`
# bind \cx\cd 'history delete --exact --case-sensitive (commandline); history save; commandline -f kill-whole-line'
