description: Review and improve the spec by asking clarifying questions
---

Review the project spec and suggest improvements.

Read `~/.claude/robenkleene/PLAN.md` and follow its instructions to resolve the plan path and understand plan conventions.

## Process

1. Read `PLAN_DIR/SPEC.md` to understand the project goals, constraints, and scope
2. Use AskUserQuestion to clarify ambiguities or missing details, such as:
   - Unclear requirements
   - Missing acceptance criteria
   - Ambiguous scope
   - Undefined edge cases
3. Based on the answers, suggest improvements to the spec
4. After confirming with the user, update `PLAN_DIR/SPEC.md` with the improvements
