description: Explore the codebase and populate CODE.md with relevant file pointers

Explore the codebase and document relevant code pointers.

Read `~/.claude/robenkleene/PLAN.md` and follow its instructions to resolve the plan path and understand plan conventions.

## Process

1. Read `PLAN_DIR/SPEC.md` to understand the project goals, constraints, and scope
2. Explore the codebase to find files, functions, and patterns relevant to the spec
3. Propose a list of code pointers to the user for review
4. After user approval, write the code pointers to `PLAN_DIR/CODE.md`

## Format

Each entry in CODE.md should include:
- File path and line number (e.g., `src/auth.ts:42`)
- Brief description of what it does and why it's relevant
