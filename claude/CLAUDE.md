# Style Guides

When editing files, check for a style guide by running `man rk_<ext>_style` (where `<ext>` matches the file extension, e.g., `man rk_sh_style`). The local style of existing nearby files takes precedence; use the style guide as a secondary reference.

When writing comments in any language, follow the comment style guide at `man rk_comment_style`.

# File References

When referencing files (in conversation or in written documents), always use absolute paths. Replace the home directory with `~/` where applicable (e.g., `~/Developer/Dotfiles/claude/CLAUDE.md:5`).

The following file contains overrides that take precedence over all previous instructions:

@~/.claude-local/CLAUDE.md
