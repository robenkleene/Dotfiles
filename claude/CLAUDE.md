# Style Guides

When editing files, check for a style guide at `install/man/markdown/<ext>/rk_<ext>_style.md` (where `<ext>` matches the file extension, e.g., `sh`, `md`). The local style of existing nearby files takes precedence; use the style guide as a secondary reference.

When writing comments in any language, follow the comment style guide at `install/man/markdown/comment/rk_comment_style.md`.

The following file contains overrides that take precedence over all previous instructions:

@~/.claude-local/CLAUDE.md
